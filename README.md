Deprecation Notice
============

NvPipe is deprecated and will receive no further updates or support. 

For a concise yet versatile convenience wrapper around the low-level NVENC/NVDEC APIs please refer to the `NvCodec` wrapper classes in the official [NVIDIA Video Codec SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk).

Several samples are included in the Video Codec SDK. Furthermore, feel free to checkout the NvPipe source code for exemplary usage.

Support inquiries and feature requests should be directed to the official [Video Codec SDK Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/professional-graphics-and-rendering/video-technologies/video-codec-and-optical-flow-sdk/189).

The original NvPipe README can be found [here](README.deprecated.md).
